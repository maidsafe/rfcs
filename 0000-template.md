One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Conventions
- The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar
with the network to understand, and for somebody familiar with the code practices to implement.
This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved questions

What parts of the design are still to be done?

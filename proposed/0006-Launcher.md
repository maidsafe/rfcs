# Summary

Launcher will be a gateway for any App that wants to work on the SAFE-Network on a user's behalf.

# Motivation

## Why?

App's access of the SAFE-Network on behalf of the user is an issue with high security concerns. Further, decentralisation allows for uniformity in experience on various machines concerning user installed Apps.

## What cases does it support?

SAFE-Launcher

<1> will allow user to create an account and/or log into the SAFE-Network.

<2> will authenticate a user installed App to access SAFE-Network on the user's behalf.

<3> will manage metadata related to Apps to give uniformity in experience when shifting from one machine to another - eg., if App `A` is installed in machine 1 then when the user logs into machine 2 using his/her SAFE-Account via Launcher, he/she will be presented with a union of all the Apps that were installed on all the machines which access the SAFE-Network on his/her behalf.

<4> along with [safe_vault](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_vault) will manage the mapping and de-mapping of ownership keys for an App (if the App requires to mutate the network on the user's behalf)

## Expected outcome

SAFE-Launcher

<1> will allow user to create an account and/or log into the SAFE-Network.

<2> will authenticate a user installed App to access SAFE-Network on the user's behalf.

<3> will manage metadata related to Apps to give uniformity in experience when shifting from one machine to another - eg., if App `A` is installed in machine 1 then when the user logs into machine 2 using his/her SAFE-Account via Launcher, he/she will be presented with a union of all the Apps that were installed on all the machines which access the SAFE-Network on his/her behalf.

<4> along with [safe_vault](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_vault) will manage the mapping and de-mapping of ownership keys for an App (if the App requires to mutate the network on the user's behalf)

# Detailed design

## User's Login Session Packet (for reference)
This is only to provide a context to the references to it below. This might change in future without affecting this RFC (ie., only a small portion of this is actually relevant for this RFC).
```
Account {
    an_maid,
    maid,
    public_maid,
    an_mpid,
    mpid,
    public_mpid,
    Option<USER’S-PRIVATE-ROOT-DIRECTORY-ID>, // This is easily accessible to the user (ie., mounted as a drive etc.).
    Option<MAIDSAFE-SPECIFIC-CONFIG-ROOT>     // This is accessible only if specifically asked and comes with a warning to not directly modify it.
}
```

## Start Flow

**step 0:** Start Launcher.

**step 1:** Enter Credentials to either create an account or to log into a previously created one.

**step 2:** If it was a log in, Launcher Fetches and decodes User-Session-Packet (USP).

**step 3:** Launcher Fetches `<MAIDSAFE-SPECIFIC-CONFIG-ROOT>` (See Session Packet description) - if not present Launcher will Create it (via [safe_nfs](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_nfs) crate)

**step 4:** Launcher Reads the special Directory reserved for it - `<MAIDSAFE-SPECIFIC-CONFIG-ROOT>/LauncherReservedDirectory`; (See Session Packet Description) - if not present Launcher will Create it (via [safe_nfs](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_nfs) crate)

**step 5:** Launcher Fetches `<USER’S-PRIVATE-ROOT-DIRECTORY-ID>` - if not present Launcher will Create it (via [safe_nfs](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_nfs) crate)

**step 6:** Launcher Checks for special Directory named `SAFEDrive` inside `<USER’S-PRIVATE-ROOT-DIRECTORY-ID>/SAFEDrive` - if not present Launcher will Create it (via [safe_nfs](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_nfs) crate). This is the directory that the user will usually see it mounted as root.

## Add App Flow

**step 0:** User Drags `XYZ` App binary into the Launcher to add it.

**step 1:** Launcher Creates (if it’s the first time it saw this App):
- Unique Random 64 Byte Id for this app - App-ID (because names of different binaries can be same if they are in different locations on the same machine - thus we need a unique identifier for the binary)
- Unique Directory Id and an associated Unique Root Directory Listing `<APP-ROOT-DIR>` for this app - `XYZ-Root-Dir`. For directory name conflicts append numbers so that they can exist on a file system - eg., `XYZ-1-Root-Dir`. This shall be created inside `<USER’S-PRIVATE-ROOT-DIRECTORY-ID>/`.
- `<APP-ROOT-DIR>` shall be always **unversioned** and **private** (ie., encrypted with App-specific crypto keys). Any requirement for a versioned or public directory from the App can be managed by the App itself by creating further subdirectories.
- Generate Random Crypto and Sign Keys for this App
- Append this information in `<LAUNCHER-CONFIG-FILE>` = `<MAIDSAFE-SPECIFIC-CONFIG-ROOT>/LauncherReservedDirectory/LauncherConfigurationFile` (This is what the DNS crate currently does too inside `<MAIDSAFE-SPECIFIC-CONFIG-ROOT>/DnsReservedDirectory/DnsConfigurationFile`.) - Format shall be CBOR (compact-binary-object-representation).
```
[
    {
        App Name,
        Reference Count,
        Random Unique App ID,    // 64 Bytes
        Vec<SHA512(App-Binary)>, // Also serves to tell how many machines where the App is added to Launcher
        <APP-ROOT-DIR>
        (PublicKeys (sign and encrypt),
         PrivateKey (sign and decrypt)),
        Vec<(DirectoryKey, CryptoKeys)> // Other directories this App is allowed to access in a shared fashion - DirectoryKey = (NameType, tag, public/private, versioned/unversioned)
        OtherMetadata, // For Future Use
    }
    {
        App Name,
        Reference Count,
        Random Unique App ID,    // 64 Bytes
        Vec<SHA512(App-Binary)>, // Also serves to tell how many machines where the App is added to Launcher
        <APP-ROOT-DIR>
        (PublicKeys (sign and encrypt),
         PrivateKey (sign and decrypt)),
        Vec<(DirectoryKey, CryptoKeys)> // Other directories this App is allowed to access in a shared fashion - DirectoryKey = (NameType, tag, public/private, versioned/unversioned)
        OtherMetadata, // For Future Use
    },
    … etc
]

struct CryptoKeys {
    box_keys: Option<(sodiumoxide::crypto::box_::PublicKey,
                      sodiumoxide::crypto::box_::SecretKey)>,       // For Read-Only Access
    ownership_keys: Option<(sodiumoxide::crypto::sign::PublicKey,
                            sodiumoxide::crypto::sign::SecretKey)>, // For Write-Only Access
}
```
- Create/Append to local config file (on the user's machine) the following:
```
[
    { App-ID, “/path/to/XYZ” }, // This is newly added by the above
    { App-ID, “/path/to/some/other/app/already/there” },
    ... etc.,
]
```
- The format of the config file will be CBOR (compact-binary-object-representation). The name of the local config file should be `<LOCAL-CONFIG-FILE> = launcher.config`. The config file location flowchart shall be same as that of `crust` crate's.

**step 2:** User activates the app (eg., double click) from within the Launcher.

**step 3:** Launcher checks the App-ID, reads the path from the `<LOCAL-CONFIG-FILE>` that it made and starts the app as an independent process. The Launcher supplies a random port on which it will listen to this app via command line options.

**./path/to/XYZ --launcher “port:33000;protocol:udp;nonce:random-u32-number”**

**step 4:** Launcher will wait for a predefined time of **15** seconds for data reception on that port. If it times out it will close the socket (release its binding to it)

**step 5:** App responds on the socket asking for Launcher to give keys and its root directory, which Launcher had reserved as `XYZ-Root-Dir`
- The payload format for this request shall be CBOR encoded sturcture of the following:
```
struct Request {
    prefix: u8,  // This must be ASCII of '?' (a question mark)
    nonce : u32, // This must be the nonce supplied by Launcher
}
```

**step 6:** Launcher reads the `<LAUNCHER-CONFIG-FILE>` and creates a mapping in the MaidManagers for associating user’s `MAID Keys <-> App specific Keys` to allow App to PUT/POST on behalf of the user in `<APP-ROOT-DIR>`.
- The mapping is done only for the ownership key/s (not encryption keys).
- The request for mapping/un-mapping shall be a command to the `MaidManagers`. For commands to `MaidManagers`, `StructuredData` with special Type-Tag will be reserved. On reception of this `StructuredData` via a `POST` message explicity directed towards MaidManagers the vaults will check the payload and act upon the request instead of executing a normal reaction to the usual `POST`s.
- `StructuredData` with Tag-Type **9** shall be reserved for `Client <-> Vault` messages.
- The messages will be defined in [safe_vault](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_vault).
- This shall be the format of `Client <-> Vault` messages:
```
pub enum ClientVaultMessage {
    MapKeys {
        ownership_key_to_map: sodiumoxide::crypto::sign::PublicKey, // Launcher-Assigned-Public-Key-For-App
    },
    UnMapKeys {
        ownership_key_to_unmap: sodiumoxide::crypto::sign::PublicKey, // Launcher-Assigned-Public-Key-For-App
    },
}
```
- These messages are acted upon by the vaults only if the message came from original owner, ie., the mapped owners shall not be allowed to perform these operations.

**step 7:** Launcher gives the **App Keys** and **App-Dir** to the App and at this point it closes its socket and is no longer associated with the App in anyway.
- The payload format for this response shall be CBOR encoded sturcture of the following, followed by hybrid_encrypt of the stream using App-specific-crypto-keys:
```
struct Response {
    root_directory_id      : NameType,
    root_directory_tag     : u64
    shared_directories     : Vec<(DirectoryKey, CryptoKeys)>,
    public_signing_key     : sodiumoxide::crypto::sign::PublicKey,
    private_signing_key    : sodiumoxide::crypto::sign::SecretKey,
    public_encrytion_key   : sodiumoxide::crypto::box_::PublicKey,
    private_encrytion_key  : sodiumoxide::crypto::box_::SecretKey,
    user_public_signing_key: sodiumoxide::crypto::sign::PublicKey, // This will allow the App to reach the correct MaidManagers
}
```

**step 8:** App does what it wants this point onwards.

## Share Directory App Flow

- User can grant an App a read and/or write access to a directory. When this is done the information is appended to `Vec<(DirectoryKey, CryptoKeys)>` for the App in `<LAUNCHER-CONFIG-FILE>`.

## Remove App Flow

**procedure 0:** Launcher removes the App as follows:
- Delete from `<LOCAL-CONFIG-FILE>` (on the user's machine) the following:
```
[
    { App-ID, “/path/to/XYZ” }, // Remove this, other entries are untouched.
    ...
]
```
- Remove the SHA512(App-Binary) from the vector in `<LAUNCHER-CONFIG-FILE>`.
- Decrement `Reference Count` from `<LAUNCHER-CONFIG-FILE>`.
- If the `Reference Count` is **0** it means that this is the last machine where the App was present. Launcher shall send a request to `MaidManagers` to un-map user's `MAID-Keys <-> App specific Keys`. The Launcher shall not delete `<APP-ROOT-DIR>` from within `SAFEDrive` folder. It is user's responsibility to do that as it might contain information (like pictures etc) which the user may not want to lose. Instead the Launcher will ask if the user wants to do that and act accordingly. Similary only after user confirmation will Launcher remove the App entry from the `<LAUNCHER-CONFIG-FILE>`, as it contains necessary metadata to decrypt the App specific directories.
- Also once the `Reference Count` is 0, the Launcher will fetch all directories mentioned in `Vec<DirectoryKey>` for the App and remove its crypto keys thus revoking the Read Access for the App into that particular directory.

**procedure 1:** While the other procedure would work, but there might be occassions when the user wants to immediately remove the app completely (which also translates as revoke App's permission to mutate network on user's behalf). He may not have access to other machines where the App was installed and maybe currently running and the previous procedure requires him to remove it from all machines to actually perform un-mapping of keys in `Vaults`. Thus there shall be an option in Launcher to remove App completely irrespective of if it is installed and/or running in other machines. In such cases Launcher will reduce `Reference Count` to 0 and proceed as above for the detection of zero reference count.

## Misc
- If the App is added to Launcher in one machine, the mention of this will go into `<LAUNCHER-CONFIG-FILE>` as stated previously. It will thus be listed on every machine when user logs into his/her account via Launcher on that machine. However when the App is attempted to be activated on a machine via Launcher where it was not previously added to Launcher then he/she will be prompted to associate a binary. Once done, the information as usual will go into the `<LOCAL-CONFIG-FILE>` on that machine and the user won't be prompted the next time.
- When the App is started via Launcher, it will first check if the `SHA512(App-Binary)` matches any one of the corresponding entries in the vector in `<LAUNCHER-CONFIG-FILE>`. If it does not Launcher will interpret this as a malacious App that has replaced the App-binary on user's machine, and thus will show a dialog to the user for confirmation  of whether to still continue, because there can be genuine reasons for binary not matching like the App was updated etc.

# Alternatives
None yet.

# Unresolved questions
**(Q0)** How will an App developer register himself?

**(Q1)** How will the app developer be recognised by the Vault on behalf of data storage to reward the developer?

**(Q2)** The Launcher is attempting to provide a sort of sandboxed environment. The Launcher will relenquish the control once the Application has been started and given its keys and directories. Since every application will sort of keep everything encrypted with its own unique crypto and ownership keys, there cannot be two applications mutating same data. Eg., there cannot be two VFS applications etc, unless they completely share the crypto as well as ownership keys. Is this ideal ? For crypto keys there can be a roundabout way to use multiple keys so that any one can decrypt, but for mutating, we might not be able to do the same thing for the ownership keys for network mutation.

**(Q3)** We could use symmetric ciphers for all cases above reducing the complexity associated with asymmetric box keys. Why are we not using symmetric keys ? Also why are MAID-encryption keys asymmetric instead of symmetric ?

**(Q4)** How do we revoke shared access for an App ? The brute force way is by decrypting and re-encrypting all Directory Listings with another key not known to the particular App whose authority we want to revoke. Is there any other, less cumbersome way ?

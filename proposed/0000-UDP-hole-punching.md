# Summary

In this text we describe an implementation of UDP hole punching process
to allow for P2P connections of nodes behind NATs in a fully decentralised
network.

# Motivation

Most users of the Crust library are expected to run the software on home PCs connected
to the Internet through a router. Routers usually implement some kind of a firewall to
prevent anyone from the outside Internet being able to connect to the user's PC directly.
As Crust is a library that creates P2P connections, it should try available techniques
to circumvent these firewall restrictions and UDP hole punching is one such
technique.

Additionally, the traditional UDP hole punching process involves a well known
server to tell each peer their external UDP endpoints. Since our intent
is a fully decentralised system, this text also describes how nodes to which
we're already connected can be used as a replacement for such a server.

In the following text the reader is expected to know basic NAT types and how they work.
The section 'Methods of translation' on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation)
gives a nice overview.

# Detailed design

The UDP hole punching process described here consists of two steps:

1. Finding an external mapping of a UDP socket
2. Do the actual hole punching.

## Finding an external mapping of a UDP socket

Suppose, we have two nodes `A` and `B`, where each one is possibly behind a NAT and
they want to connect to each other.  Routing needs to send `A` an endpoint of `B` and
vice versa. But `A` and `B` don’t know their public
endpoints a priori (they may know their IP addresses from previous connection establishments,
but not their ports). Each node therefore needs to create a UDP socket and use it to ask some
other node it is connected to what the public endpoint of the UDP socket is. We’ll refer
to such helping nodes `C(A)` and `C(B)` (it need not be the same node for `A` and `B`).
We'll call `U(C(X))` the UDP port on which X can contact `C(X)` in order to find its public
endpoint. `X` finds out about `U(C(X))` through the initial handhsake, that is, when
`X` connects to `C(X)`.

In the following text we’ll describe steps taken at node `A`, but the same steps need to
be taken at node `B`.

For `A` to find out its external address `A` first needs to create a UDP socket `S(A)`
with an arbitrary local port.  `A` will then use `S(A)` to periodically send
datagrams to `U(C(A))` containing a MAGIC number and the ID of the request. Each time
`C(A)` receives such datagram, it sends back a datagram containing public endpoint
of `S(A)` together with the request ID.

The above protocol shall be initiated from upper layers by calling

    Service::get_mapped_udp_socket(callback: FnBox<(io::Result<MappedUdpSocket>)>)

And the result of such a call shall be an invocation of the callback.

where `MappedUdpSocket` is defined as

    struct MappedUdpSocket {
        udp_socket: UdpSocket,
        public_address: SocketAddr, // of node A
    }

Once upper layers receive such an event, they can send/route `MappedUdpSocket::public_address`
to node `B`. Once `B` does the same, and upper layers receive `B`’s public endpoint, upper
layers are ready for the actual hole punching.

## Hole punching

The act of hole punching shall be initiated by a function with the following signature:

    Service::udp_punch_hole(udp_socket: UdpSocket,
                            secret: Option<[u8; 4]>,
                            peer_addr: mut SocketAddr /* of node B */,
                            callback: FnBox<(UdpSocket, io::Result<SocketAddr>)>)

This call will initiate reading on the `udp_socket` and will also
start periodically sending small datagrams to the `peer_addr`.
These datagrams will be of type:

    struct HolePunch {
        secret: Option<[u8; 4]>,
        ack: bool,
    }

At this stage, we may receive the above datagram either from `peer_addr`
or from some other endpoint. If the latter, it can mean one of two things:

* The other end is behind a Symmetric NAT and we're behind a Full-cone or no NAT.
  This is OK but we need to adjust the `peer_addr` variable to point
  to this new peer.
* Some other application is sending us irrelevant or malicious packets. We
  can distinguish this case by matching the `secret` passed to the function as an
  argument with `datagram.secret`. If secrets don't match, we ignore the datagram.

Once we receive a datagram from the remote peer, we know the hole has been
punched. Since the other end is waiting for our datagram as well, we need
to make a "best effort" to ensure the other end receives our packet as well.
That is, we need to make sure at least one of the following conditions is true:

1. We sent our datagram to `peer_addr` `K` times (for some predefined `K`).
2. We receive `HolePunch` packet with the `ack` field set to true.

Note that the condition ((1) or (2)) will always be satisfied eventually,
so the decision whether hole punching was successful or not shall
be based purely on the fact whether we have received a datagram or not, that is,
once ((1) or (2)) is true, we check whether we've received a datagram,
if we did, we call the `callback` with `(udp_socket, Ok(peer_addr))`,
otherwise we call it with an appropriate `io::Error`.

## Using the punched hole

After a successful hole-punch, it is assumed that the two peers can communicate
with each other over the unreliable UDP protocol. At this point we'd like to
use that UDP socket with protocols such as uTP for added reliability.

Unfortunately, the rust-utp library doesn't currently support rendezvous
connections, so this functionality will need to be added.

# Drawbacks

The alternative approach described in the next section is simpler in that it doesn't require
two async calls, instead, it uses only one. Other than that, the simpler approach
is limited in number of NAT types it can successfully punch through.

# Alternatives

Another approach would work with the use of multiplexing. That is, if we had a UDP socket
which is already connected to a remote peer, we could also use it to communicate
with other peers as the hole has already been punched. A problem with this approach is
that it would only help with Full-cone NAT types because it is the only NAT
type where a hole punched to one peer/host can be reused with other peers/hosts.

# Unresolved questions

## What asynchronous primitives should be used for this?

Here are the available options:

1. Enum events over channels. This is what Routing is currently using. It is an improvement
   from the visitor pattern we had before, but is still very hard to use. The main
   disadvantage is that with this approach it is most inconvenient to combine
   two or more async calls into one. E.g. in our current context, we'd like to
   combine the `get_mapped_udp_socket` call with the `udp_punch_hole` call.
   Using the event enums approach, the user needs to hold a state outside of the Crust library
   to know what should happen after a `get_mapped_udp_socket` event arrives.

2. Coroutines: these are nice primitives to work with; they do allow for two
   or more coroutines to be combined together. However they are not generic
   enough to express all different combinations asynchronous programming has to offer.
   I.e. coroutines only allow for sequential combination of coroutines,
   more advanced patterns (such as "start many async actions and continue when
   all of them finish") need to be complemented with other approaches.

3. Futures: these (AFAIK) have bigger combinatorial power than coroutines and
   many libraries already ship with these patterns abstracted (think of functions
   like `when_any` or `when_all`). That said, they have the disadvantage
   that they combine blocking and non-blocking paradigms, resulting in
   slower code (read [this](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4045.pdf) for
   more info on the topic).

4. Continuation Passing Style: Callbacks are lightweight, fast and offer
   biggest combinatorial power. This comes with the price that they are often
   referred to as hard to read. On the other hand, the combinatorial power allows
   for complex and hard-to-read patterns to be hidden behind
   other callback taking functions with more descriptive names.

## How to chose `C(X)`?

One criterion for `C(X)` is that it should not be on the same local network as `X`.
For this we could use the `getifaddrs` function, it gives us `SocketAddrs`
of our network interfaces, plus the netmasks they use. This information should
be enough to determine whether `C(X)` is in the same subnet as a given
interface.

## Should `C(X)` be only one node?

If we allow for `C(X)` to be more than one node, we could get a response quicker
and more reliably. Additionally getting more than one response can reveal
the information whether we're behind a Symmetric NAT as two different
`C(X)` nodes will disagree about our port number in such cases.

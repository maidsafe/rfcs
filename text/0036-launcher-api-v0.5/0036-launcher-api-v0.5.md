# Summary

Adding new features to the safe_launcher API to improve efficiency and also to
incorporate the standards that were missing in the 0.4 version of the API.

# Motivation

New features to the existing API can improve handling large data volume efficiently
using streaming APIs. This can have a significant improvement in the performance
of the launcher and the safe-core ffi for handling large data volume.
Incorporating the standards in the API will also improve the stability of the APIs
and make it easier for third party applications to integrate.

# Detailed design

Categorising the proposals into two sections `Enhancements` and `New Features`.
These features are also based on the suggestion from [cretz](https://forum.safenetwork.io/users/cretz/activity)
in the [forum thread](https://forum.safenetwork.io/t/safe-launcher-dev-issues-suggestions/7890)

## Enhancements

### Remove session based encryption between application and launcher

Since the launcher and the integrating applications are running on the local machine,
the session based encryption during the data transfer is a mere over head. Removing the
session based encryption can have a significant improvement in the performance.
However the JWT tokens for validating and authorising the applications would still hold
good. The authorisation process workflow will be the same and the applications
have to pass the JWT token in the `authorization` header for authorised requests.
if the user denies authorisation, Unauthorised (401) status code is returned.

**Authorised requests need no encryption for parameters or even the payload. But must
pass the authorisation token in the request header**

#### Authorisation Request

##### Request

###### Endpoint
`/auth`

###### Method
`POST`

###### Body
```
{
  app: {
    name: String,
    version: String,
    vendor:  String,
    id: String
  },
  permissions: Array[String]
}
```

##### Response

###### Status code
```
200
```

###### Body
```
{
  token: String, // JWT token
  permissions: Array[String]  
}
```

### Remove unnecessary Base64 conversions

At present the APIs exchange data as base64 strings, which is unnecessary while
the raw data can be directly sent over HTTP. The request and response can
directly use the actual content based on the `Content-type`.

For example, the APIs which accept the JSON payload can simply `POST/PUT` the JSON payload
without base64 encoding or encryption. Like wise the response will also be a plain JSON String (UTF-8).

For the APIs which involves binary data such as the file upload, the binary data
can be directly sent instead of encrypting and then encoding to a base64 string.

**Removal of base64 encoding has to be handled across all the APIs**

### Custom headers naming convention

Rename custom headers to start with `X-` as mentioned in the [RFC](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2047.txt)

### Refactor Read File Response Headers

The get file response of the [NFS API](./text/0018-launcher-as-rest-server/nfs_api.md#response-headers-5)
has custom headers. Remove the custom headers because the metadata request (HEAD) can be used
to fetch the file metadata and restrict the GET file requests only for reading the content of the file.

### Streaming API

The launcher API can not to handle large file sizes as it requires to read the entire content
in memory to upload the whole file content and also in a chunked upload there are excess data chunks
being created in the network when a large file is saved.

Exposing a streaming API can improve the efficiency to handle larger data upload.
For creating and reading binary data, the APIs must be able to support streaming (read / write).

Nodejs exposes [Stream API](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) for creating a custom read / write streams.
The GET APIs must be able to serve the data from the network using a readable stream,
while the PUT / POST APIs must be able to use a writable stream to pipe the received data to the network.

The FFI interface must pass the self_encryption handle to the caller and the caller can use the
handle to read and write the data. After the operation is complete, the caller must call the ffi
api to drop the handle.

#### APIs that must support streaming

GET APIs from [NFS](./text/0018-launcher-as-rest-server/nfs_api.md#read-file)
and [DNS](./text/0018-launcher-as-rest-server/dns_api.md#get-file-unregistered-client-access)
must be able to serve data using the readable streams.

[NFS API to update file content](./text/0018-launcher-as-rest-server/nfs_api.md#update-file-content)
must be able to read the incoming data stream and write the data to the network using a
writable stream.

### Using Content Range Header

Using the `Range` HTTP header can help in removing the offset and length parameters
and drift towards a standard approach for partial read / write operations.

Example usage:
```
Range: bytes=0-
Range: bytes=0-100
```

If the range header is not specified, the entire file is streamed while reading and
the data is appended to the end while writing.

### Response Headers

#### File Read

If the entire file is streamed then the Status code returned will be `200`.
If only a partial section of the file is read, then the status code will be `206`.

Response headers,
```
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: <Length that is requested based on the byte range>
Content-Type: <mime type if available based on the extension or application/octet-stream>
Content-Range: bytes <START>-<END>/<TOTAL>
```

#### File write

Status code `200` will be returned on success.

### Streaming Issue in the Web Platform

Streaming over HTTP is out of the box supported in most of the platforms. Similarly,
web browsers also provide support for the streaming data using the default widgets (audio / video controls) provided.

Could not find an out of the box option for streaming upload of large data. The available
options to write huge files is to use the HTML Form or FormData and send using multipart upload.
The other option was to write data in chunks to the server, that again is not an ideal
solution, since the client has to create many short lived connections for uploading the data in smaller chunks.

Thus the NFS file content upload API must be able to support multipart upload. The API
would consider the upload only for one file at a time, i.e. can not upload the file contents
of multiple files at one go. The API will be reading the data only for one file and
close the response accordingly if it is a multipart request.


## Error message propagation

The FFI interface returns error codes as its return value. The problem with this
approach is that the error message or reason for the error has to be mapped in the launcher.

FFI interface can respond in a JSON format which will help in propagating the error codes
and also the associated reason,

### On Failure

```javascript
{  
  "error": {
    "code": -100,
    "reason": "Low data balance error"
  }  
}
```

### On Success

If the response does not return any data, for example, create public-id API,

```javascript
{
  "error": null, // Optional - error field can be removed
}
```

**or** `just an empty String`.

If the response has to return data, for example service list, the JSON format can be

```javascript
{
  "error": null, // Optional - error field can be removed on success response
  "data": [
    'www',
    'blog'
  ]
}
```

FFI interface has two functions `execute` and `exceute_for_content`. The `exceute_for_content`
method can be dropped and the `execute` method can be modified to accept the parameters
as in `execute_for_content`,

```
pub extern "C" fn execute(c_payload: *const c_char,
                          c_size: *mut int32_t,
                          c_capacity: *mut int32_t,
                          c_result: *mut int32_t,
                          ffi_handle: *const c_void) {
    // Do the processing here
    // write the result to the c_result pointer
}
```

The REST APIs can send the error message in the response as plain text. The error code of the
FFI can be ignored and only the error message will be sent to the integrating applications.

# Drawbacks

TLS option is not considered in this version.

# Alternatives

### Additional API can be added to facilitate the streaming uploads from the web browsers
1. The local launcher server can also listen for web socket connections at the same launcher port.

2. The client will call an api (PUT /nfs/file/worker/:filePath/:isPathShared). The API will get the metadata
to locate the file as a part of the request and get the self_encryptor handle for writing the file contents
and hold the handle in memory(HashMap<UUID, SE_HANDLE>) associating to a random ID. The random ID
is sent as part of the response.

3. Once the client gets the ID, it can spawn a WebWorker and start streaming the data through the websocket connection.
  ```
  {
    type: 'STREAM',
    id: <Random ID received>,
    data: <Array Buffer>
  }
  ```
  when the data is received the server can validate the ID and write the data to
  network.

### File Metadata Request (HEAD)

The file metadata request sends the response in in the header fields. As an alternate approach,
instead of the headers the metadata can be sent as a JSON response. [AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectHEAD.html)
uses the headers approach while [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objects/get#parameters) uses JSON response.
Since the fields that are sent back is minimal, the preference was for using the headers.

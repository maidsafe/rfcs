# Structured Data API

## Create

Structured data has a size restriction of 100KiB including its internals.
If the size is more than permitted size after serialisation, error is returned.

Versioned, Unversioned or Custom Structured data types can be created.
If the size of the data being passed is greater than 100KiB, the versioned and unversioned
structured data will ensure that the data is managed and stored successfully.
But for custom type_tags it becomes the responsibility of the application
to handle the size restriction.


|Type| tag| Description|
|-----|---------|-----------|
| Unversioned | 500 | Has only the one latest copy |
| Versioned | 501 | Will hold version history. Can fetch an older version based on a version number|
| Custom | 15000 > | Apps are free to use any tagType value greater than 15000 |


The data is be encrypted based on the Encryption enum value specified.

|Encryption| Description|
|-----|-----------|
|NONE| Data is not encrypted|
|SYMMETRIC| Data is encrypted using symmetric key - only the user can read the data|
|HYBRID| Data is encrypted using hybrid encryption for sharing the data secure|

The hybrid encryption is detailed in the [safe_core low level api RFC](https://github.com/maidsafe/rfcs/blob/master/text/0041-low-level-api/0041-low-level-api.md)

The tag type and Id combination is needed for fetching the Structured Data from the network.

The Id is a base64 string representing [u8; 32] array.

The DataIdentifier handle is obtained after creation of a structured data. The Data Identifier handle is
needed for working with the structured data and this must be dropped after the usage.

The [appendable data](./appendable_data.md) can accept only Data Identifier to appened.
